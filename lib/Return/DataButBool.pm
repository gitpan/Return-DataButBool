=head1 NAME

Return::DataButBool - Return a boolean value that also has arbitrary numeric and string values


=head1 VERSION

This document describes Return::DataButBool version 0.0.1

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Return::DataButBool;

    sub whatever {
	    ...
	    return $ok ? data_but_true( $count ) : data_but_false( $count, $error );
    }

later in the code using this function:

    my $total = 0;
    for my $thing ( @stuff ) {
	    my $rc = whatever( $thing );
	    $total += $rc; # numeric value
	
	    if( !$rc ) { # boolean value
		    carp "Error happened: $rc"; # string value
	    }
    }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl's Zero-But-True ( EOE ) is a most handy tool. This module expands on that idea by having a return value that has different boolean, numeric, and string values.

For example you could return a count of files processed (say 42 which is "true") but still say it failed in boolean context.

or you could return any false value ( not just '0' ) but still return true. The flexibility allows for all sorts of use.

=head1 EXPORT

All 3 functions are exported by default.

=head1 INTERFACE 

The data_but_* functions take one or two arguments.

The first is the numeric value. Can be signed and/or decimal if you like. If its not [+-] digit [decimal digit] then it is passed through int() - see _get_num_from()

The second is the string value. If not specified the numeric value is used.

=head2 zero_but_true()

takes no args, returns good 'ol E0E (zero but true) for

=head2 data_but_true()

The value returned evaluates to true in a boolean context. The numeric and string context are determined by the arguments passed as describe above.

=head2 data_but_false()

The value returned evaluates to false in a boolean context. The numeric and string context are determined by the arguments passed as describe above.

=head2 Internal functions

=head3 _get_num_from()

This function makes sure your first argument is numeric ( possible sign, digits, possihle decimal point more digits - or int() )

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Throws no errors or warnings

=head1 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

Return::DataButBool requires no configuration files or environment variables.

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

This uses the excellent L<Contextual::Return> whcih can be used if your return needs are more complicated than this module's purpose.

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported.
